# 🏁 Maze Solver

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Maze Solver** using Python and OpenCV. The script processes an input maze image, identifies the start and end points, and finds the optimal path using pathfinding algorithms.

## 🚀 Features
- Reads and processes maze images
- Detects obstacles, paths, start, and end points
- Solves the maze using **graph traversal algorithms** (e.g., BFS, DFS, A* search)
- Visualizes the solution with OpenCV and Matplotlib

## 🔧 Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy
```

## 📂 Usage
Run the script to solve a given maze:

```sh
python maze_solver.py
```

Ensure that your maze image is stored in the expected directory.

## 📸 Example Output
The script will display the original maze alongside the solved maze with the path highlighted.

## 🏗️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **OpenCV** (Image processing)
- **Matplotlib** (Visualization)
- **NumPy** (Data manipulation)

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Support for different maze formats
- More efficient pathfinding algorithms
- GUI for interactive maze solving
